A GUI tool for inspecting Java Swing GUIs.

##  Building from source

For each of `swingexplorer-core` and `swingexplorer-agent`, cd in to them and run `mvn clean package` to build them.

To test whether the build worked, you can cd in to `swingexplorer-core` and run `dev-tools/launch_sample.sh` to run the sample application.
